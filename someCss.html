            <p>To the right is an image of a fractal (ooh, pretty). According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Wikipedia</a>, 
            a fractal is <q>an abstract object used to describe and simulate naturally occurring objects</q>. Fractals are cool because 
            they have repeating patterns that go on forever. Fractals are some of the most beautiful and most bizarre geometric shapes. 
            They look the same at various different scales – you can take a small extract of the shape and it looks the same as the entire shape. 
            This curious property is called self-similarity. To create a fractal, you can start with a simple pattern and repeat it at smaller scales, 
            again and again, forever. In real life, of course, it is impossible to draw fractals with “infinitely small” patterns. However we can 
            draw shapes which look just like fractals. Using mathematics, we can think about the properties a real fractal would have – and these 
            are very surprising.</p>

            <p>To the left is an image of Smarties. Yes, these are Smarties. Those round pastel things are <strong>Rockets</strong>
            (see image to the right). In the United States, Smarties are a type of tablet candy produced by Smarties Candy Company, 
            formerly known as Ce De Candy Inc., since 1949. ... The candies distributed in Canada are marketed as Rockets, to avoid 
            confusion with Nestlé's Smarties.</p>
